All I can say is that he has always been a person who has got your back. He gave brilliant ideas and solutions when we were stuck on a project task. That is why I always wanted to work with him on any group assignment or project. He never backed away from working on new technology. He is upright, honest, and responsible, considering his work life. He is ambitious and willing to grow in skillsets.`,
